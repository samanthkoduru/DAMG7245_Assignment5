We can use this historical information to construct an ML model of one mobile operator’s churn using a process called training. After training the model, we can pass the profile information of an arbitrary customer (the same profile information that we used to train the model) to the model, and have the model predict whether this customer is going to churn. Of course, we expect the model to make mistakes–after all, predicting the future is tricky business! But I’ll also show how to deal with prediction errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're going to use a SageMaker feature call Batch Transform to facilitate this. In a real-world deployment, you will probably leverage Batch Transform along side an ETL tool with a workflow manager to orchestrate pipeline stages.\n",

    "You might use Batch Transform in place of a Hosted Endpoint for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Batch Transform is better optimized for throughput in comparison with real-time inference endpoints. Thus, Batch Transform is ideal for processing large volumes of data for analytics.\n",
    " - Offline asynchronous processing is acceptable for most analytics use cases.\n",
    " - Batch Transform is more cost efficient when real-time inference isn't necessary. You only need to pay for resources used during batch processing. There is no need to pay for ongoing resources like a hosted endpoint for real-time inference.\n",
    " \n",
    "You might use Hosted Endpoints with External Functions for reasons such as:\n",
